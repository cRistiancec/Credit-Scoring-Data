# Credit-Scoring-Data
Logistic Model and Classification Tree for Credit Scoring Data

The main aim of this report is to find a method with which we can estimate whether the credit score
of a person is on par or not. i.e. to determine if a person has good enough credit score to approve
bank loans etc. The performance of the solution is a key factor since the accuracy of the prediction is
very important.
